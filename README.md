# Unsupervised-_Fault_Detection-Industrial_Process
This repository contains code for analyzing the TEP dataset, which is a public dataset for evaluating fault detection and diagnosis algorithms in industrial systems. The dataset includes measurements from a simulated production line, and faults are introduced at specific times during the production process.
