## Introduction
This code uses the TEP dataset to analyze and visualize the Fault-Free and Faulty data. The main objective is to detect any anomalies in the data using basic statistical analysis. If any variable goes out of the pre-defined limit, then the code generates an error. This repository is a part of [youtube playlist](https://youtu.be/iCTU-IZ6rPQ).

## Usage/Examples

Video 1: [Statistical Method for Anomaly Detection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCTU-IZ6rPQ&list=PLoSULBSCtoffIldbr898SDp5gIqo8XL-t&index=2&t=73s) 

In this video, we will provide an introduction to statistical methods for anomaly detection. We will discuss the basic concepts of statistical process control, including control charts and process capability analysis. We will also demonstrate how to detect anomalies using statistical methods.

Video 2: PCA Reconstruction-based Anomaly Detection

In this video, we will introduce the concept of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and demonstrate how it can be used for anomaly detection. We will also discuss the limitations of PCA and how it can be improved by incorporating additional features.

Video 3: Autoencoder-based Reconstruction

In this video, we will introduce autoencoders and demonstrate how they can be used for anomaly detection. We will also discuss the various types of autoencoders and their applications.

Video 4: Ensemble Learning (Light Gradient Boost)

In this video, we will introduce ensemble learning techniques and demonstrate how Light Gradient Boost can be used for anomaly detection. We will also discuss the advantages of ensemble learning over single models.

Video 5: CNN, LSTM-based Next Step Prediction

In this video, we will introduce convolutional neural networks (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) models and demonstrate how they can be used for next-step prediction in the Tennessee Eastman Process dataset. We will also discuss how this technique can be used for anomaly detection.

Video 6: Transformer-based Anomaly Detection

In this video, we will introduce transformers and demonstrate how they can be used for anomaly detection in the Tennessee Eastman Process dataset. We will also discuss the advantages of transformer models over traditional machine learning models.

Video 7: XAI Method on Autoencoders

In this video, we will introduce Explainable AI (XAI) and demonstrate how it can be used on autoencoders to explain the anomalies detected by the model. We will also discuss the importance of XAI in complex industrial processes.
